State-of-the-art Machine Learning for the web. Run 🤗 Transformers directly in your browser, with no need for a server!

Transformers.js is designed to be functionally equivalent to Hugging Face's [transformers](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers) python library, meaning you can run the same pretrained models using a very similar API. These models support common tasks in different modalities, such as:
  - 📝 **Natural Language Processing**: text classification, named entity recognition, question answering, language modeling, summarization, translation, multiple choice, and text generation.
  - 🖼️ **Computer Vision**: image classification, object detection, segmentation, and depth estimation.
  - 🗣️ **Audio**: automatic speech recognition, audio classification, and text-to-speech.
  - 🐙 **Multimodal**: embeddings, zero-shot audio classification, zero-shot image classification, and zero-shot object detection.

Transformers.js uses [ONNX Runtime](https://onnxruntime.ai/) to run models in the browser. The best part about it, is that you can easily [convert](#convert-your-models-to-onnx) your pretrained PyTorch, TensorFlow, or JAX models to ONNX using [🤗 Optimum](https://github.com/huggingface/optimum#onnx--onnx-runtime).

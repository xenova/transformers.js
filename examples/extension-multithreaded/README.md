# Transformers.js - Sample browser extension

An example project to show how to run ðŸ¤— Transformers in a browser extension. Although we only provide instructions for running in Chrome, it should be similar for other browsers.

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repo and enter the project directory:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/xenova/transformers.js.git
    cd transformers.js/examples/extension/
    ```
1. Install the necessary dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install 
    ```

1. Build the project:
    ```bash
    npm run build 
    ```

1. Add the extension to your browser. To do this, go to `chrome://extensions/`, enable developer mode (top right), and click "Load unpacked". Select the `build` directory from the dialog which appears and click "Select Folder".

1. That's it! You should now be able to open the extenion's popup and use the model in your browser!

## Editing the template

We recommend running `npm run dev` while editing the template as it will rebuild the project when changes are made. 

All source code can be found in the `./src/` directory:
- `background.js` ([service worker](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/mv3/service_workers/)) - handles all the requests from the UI, does processing in the background, then returns the result. You will need to reload the extension (by visiting `chrome://extensions/` and clicking the refresh button) after editing this file for changes to be visible in the extension.

- `content.js` ([content script](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/mv3/content_scripts/)) - contains the code which is injected into every page the user visits. You can use the `sendMessage` api to make requests to the background script. Similarly, you will need to reload the extension after editing this file for changes to be visible in the extension.

- `popup.html`, `popup.css`, `popup.js` ([toolbar action](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/action/)) - contains the code for the popup which is visible to the user when they click the extension's icon from the extensions bar. For development, we recommend opening the `popup.html` file in its own tab by visiting `chrome-extension://<ext_id>/popup.html` (remember to replace `<ext_id>` with the extension's ID). You will need to refresh the page while you develop to see the changes you make.
